# Changelog

## 0.10.0

### Added
- **Native Gemini CLI extension**: Install with `gemini extensions install https://github.com/jpeggdev/tribunal.git`. Includes extension manifest (`gemini-extension.json`), context file (`GEMINI.md`), and 12 TOML commands in `commands/tribunal/`
- **Native Codex CLI package**: Install with `curl -sSL .../install.sh | bash`. Clones repo and symlinks skills into `~/.agents/skills/`. Skills are invoked by their SKILL.md `name` field (e.g., `$start`, `$setup`). Includes install script (`.codex/install.sh`) and usage guide (`.codex/README.md`)
- **YAML frontmatter added** to 3 skills that lacked it: `create-issue`, `handling-pr-comments`, `pr-shepherd`. All 13 skills now have proper frontmatter for Codex discoverability
- **Cross-platform installer**: `npx tribunal init` detects installed CLIs (claude, codex, gemini) and installs tribunal for each. Supports `--claude`, `--codex`, `--gemini` flags for targeted install
- **Platform detection module** (`lib/platform-detect.js`): Detects installed CLIs, returns config paths and install methods for each platform
- **Platform adaptation reference** (`skills/start/references/platform-adaptation.md`): Documents tool equivalents, graceful degradation, and command syntax across all three platforms
- **Instruction file templates**: `templates/AGENTS.md`, `templates/AGENTS-append.md`, `templates/GEMINI.md`, `templates/GEMINI-append.md` for Codex and Gemini project setup
- **Multi-platform setup**: `lib/setup-mandatory-files.sh` now supports `--platform claude|codex|gemini|all` flag to write platform-appropriate instruction files
- **Platform-aware session-start hook**: `hooks/session-start.sh` self-locates its plugin root using `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, `$extensionPath`, or script directory fallback
- **TOML command sync**: `lib/sync-resources.js` now generates and validates Gemini TOML commands, checks version sync across all manifests (package.json, plugin.json, gemini-extension.json)
- **Test suites**: `tests/gemini/`, `tests/codex/`, `tests/cli/` with validation for extension structure, skill symlinks, and installer behavior
- **`AGENTS.md` at repo root**: Codex CLI instruction file with tribunal workflow, quality gates, and session completion rules
- **`GEMINI.md` at repo root**: Gemini CLI extension context with commands, quality gates, and platform notes

### Changed
- **npm package un-deprecated**: `package.json` no longer has `deprecated` field. The npm package is now the cross-platform installer
- **npm package description**: Updated to "Cross-platform installer for tribunal"
- **CLI rewritten** (`cli/tribunal.js`): Now supports `init`, `setup`, `detect` commands with platform flags. Replaces old deprecation-warning-only behavior
- **Version bumped to 0.10.0** across: `package.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `gemini-extension.json`
- README.md, INSTALL.md, GETTING_STARTED.md updated with Codex and Gemini installation paths
- `package.json` `files` array updated to include `lib/`, `.codex/`, `AGENTS.md`, `GEMINI.md`, `gemini-extension.json`
- `package.json` `keywords` updated to include `codex-cli` and `gemini-cli`

## 0.9.2

### Changed
- Updated plugin.json description with Gemini/Codex and accurate counts

## 0.9.1

### Fixed
- Corrected plugin install commands throughout docs

## 0.9.0

### Added
- **Claude Code marketplace plugin distribution**: tribunal is now installed via `claude plugin marketplace add jpeggdev/tribunal && claude plugin install tribunal`, replacing the npm `npx tribunal init` method. The npm package is deprecated and prints a deprecation warning
- **Setup skill** (`skills/setup/`): Interactive guided project setup that replaces `npx tribunal init`. Detects language, framework, test runner, linter, and CI, then configures everything automatically
- **Migrate skill** (`skills/migrate/`): Automated migration from npm installation to plugin. Detects old `.claude/plugins/tribunal/` files, verifies content matches, removes stale copies, and creates project-local command shims
- **Status skill** (`skills/status/`): 9 diagnostic checks — plugin version, project setup, command shims, legacy install detection, BEADS plugin, bd CLI, external tools, coverage thresholds, and Node.js
- **Session-start hook** (`hooks/session-start.sh`): Context priming, legacy npm installation detection with migration prompt, BEADS dedup, and self-healing mandatory file writes
- **`/start` alias command**: Shorthand for `/start-task`
- **`/setup` command**: Routes to the setup skill (replaces `/tribunal-setup`)
- **`/update` command**: Routes to plugin update (replaces `/tribunal-update-version`)
- **`/status` command**: Routes to the status diagnostic skill
- **Shell script for mandatory files**: `hooks/session-start.sh` writes CLAUDE.md and other required files if the agent skips them, ensuring projects always have the correct configuration
- **Marketplace repository**: Created `jpeggdev/tribunal` for plugin distribution
- **Cross-CLI validation**: Setup and migration workflows validated across Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and Codex CLI

### Changed
- **Primary installation method**: Plugin marketplace (`claude plugin install tribunal`) replaces npm (`npx tribunal init`)
- **npm package deprecated**: `package.json` includes deprecation notice pointing to plugin marketplace
- **Command names simplified**: `/tribunal-setup` → `/setup`, `/tribunal-update-version` → `/update` (legacy aliases preserved)
- Updated counts: 13 skills (was 9), 15 commands (was 9), 8 rubrics

### Upgrade Instructions
- **From v0.7.x / v0.8.x**: Run `claude plugin marketplace add jpeggdev/tribunal && claude plugin install tribunal`, then `/tribunal:migrate` in Claude Code to clean up old npm-installed files. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md#upgrading-to-v090) for details
- **From v0.6.x or earlier**: Same as above, then run `/setup` to get the interactive configuration
- **Already on plugin**: Run `/update` in Claude Code

## 0.8.0

### Added
- **Workflow enforcement rules** in CLAUDE.md templates: mandatory intercepts at every superpowers handoff point (brainstorming → writing-plans → executing-plans → finishing-a-branch) to ensure quality gates are never bypassed
- **Execution method choice**: agents now always ask the user whether to use tribunal orchestrated execution (more thorough, more tokens) or superpowers execution skills (faster, lighter-weight) — no default, user decides
- **BEADS context persistence**: approved plans, project context, and execution state are written to `.beads/plans/` and `.beads/context/` so agents can recover after context compaction or session interruption
- **Context recovery protocol** (`bd prime --work-type recovery`): reloads approved plan, completed work, and current execution position from disk after context loss
- **Start-task recovery check**: detects interrupted executions at startup, asks user to resume or start fresh
- **Pre-PR self-reflect**: knowledge capture moved from post-merge to before PR creation; KB updates are committed as part of the PR so learnings land atomically with the code
- **Subagent discipline rules**: `--no-verify` prohibition, TDD enforcement, file scope rules, and no-self-certify rules added to coder-agent and orchestrated-execution spawn templates
- **EnterPlanMode intercept**: CLAUDE.md instructs agents to use `/start-task` instead of `EnterPlanMode` for tasks touching 3+ files (EnterPlanMode bypasses all quality gates)
- **Standalone TDD review**: after TDD sessions modifying 3+ files, agent asks user if they want adversarial review before committing
- **Coverage source of truth unification**: `.coverage-thresholds.json` is now explicitly the single source of truth across all skills including `verification-before-completion`
- **Plan persistence in plan-review-gate**: approved plans are written to `.beads/plans/active-plan.md` after gate approval + user approval
- **Execution state tracking**: `.beads/context/execution-state.md` tracks current work unit, phase, and retry count across phase transitions

### Changed
- **Command namespace simplified**: removed `/project:` prefix from 259 references across 52 files — commands now use `/start-task`, `/review-design`, `/self-reflect`, etc.
- **Brainstorming-extension rewritten**: replaced aspirational YAML triggers with documentation of the actual 3-layer enforcement mechanism (CLAUDE.md instructions, start-task command, skill documents)
- **Project Context Document now persisted to disk**: written to `.beads/context/project-context.md` and updated after each work unit commit
- **PR shepherd self-reflect timing**: post-merge knowledge capture is now a fallback only (primary capture happens pre-PR)
- **Cross-platform sed syntax**: cleanup commands use `OSTYPE` detection for macOS vs GNU/Linux compatibility
- **Gitignore template**: added `!.env.example` negation, BEADS runtime exclusions, and execution state exclusions
- **Code fence language specifiers**: added `text` language to all bare fenced code blocks for markdown lint compliance
- Updated counts: 9 skills (was 8), 9 commands, 8 rubrics

## 0.7.1

### Fixed
- `npx tribunal init --full` crashed because npm strips `.gitignore` files from packages. Renamed template to `gitignore` (no dot) so it ships correctly.

## 0.7.0

### Added
- **Claude-guided installation** (`/tribunal-setup`): Interactive setup that detects your project's language, framework, test runner, linter, formatter, package manager, CI system, and git hooks — then customizes everything automatically. Supports 7 languages (TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby, JavaScript), 15+ frameworks, and all major toolchains
- **Self-update command** (`/tribunal-update-version`): Check for new tribunal versions, show changelog, update files, re-detect project context, and refresh the project profile
- **Project profile** (`.tribunal/project-profile.json`): Stores detection results, user choices, and derived commands for future reference and updates
- **`npx tribunal install`** CLI command: Separate heavy file-copy operation that can be invoked by the setup skill or run directly

### Changed
- **`npx tribunal init` is now a thin bootstrap**: Copies only 3 files (tribunal-setup command, tribunal-update-version command, minimal CLAUDE.md reference) instead of 60+ files. Points user to `/tribunal-setup` for interactive guided setup
- **`npx tribunal init --full`** preserves the legacy behavior (init + install in one step) for CI/scripting environments
- README.md install section rewritten around two-step guided flow
- INSTALL.md restructured: "Recommended: Claude-Guided Setup" as primary, "Manual / CI Installation" as fallback
- GETTING_STARTED.md quickstart updated to the new flow
- CLAUDE.md template updated with both new commands

## 0.6.0

### Added
- **External AI tool delegation** (`skills/external-tools/`): Delegate implementation and review tasks to OpenAI Codex CLI and Google Gemini CLI. Cross-model adversarial review ensures the writer is always reviewed by a different model. Availability-aware escalation chain: Model A (2 tries) → Model B (2 tries) → Claude (1 try) → user alert
- **Codex CLI adapter** (`skills/external-tools/adapters/codex.sh`): Shell adapter for OpenAI Codex CLI with health, implement, and review commands
- **Gemini CLI adapter** (`skills/external-tools/adapters/gemini.sh`): Shell adapter for Google Gemini CLI with health, implement, and review commands
- **Shared adapter helpers** (`skills/external-tools/adapters/_common.sh`): 14 shared helper functions including `safe_invoke()` with macOS-compatible timeout fallback, worktree management, cost extraction, structured JSON output, and error classification
- **Cross-model review rubric** (`rubrics/external-tool-review-rubric.md`): Binary PASS/FAIL rubric for cross-model adversarial review with file:line evidence requirements
- **External tools config template** (`templates/external-tools.yaml`): Per-project configuration for adapter settings, routing strategy, and budget limits
- **External tools setup guide** (`templates/external-tools-setup.md`): User-facing installation and authentication guide for Codex and Gemini CLI
- **`/external-tools-health` command** (`commands/external-tools-health.md`): Slash command to check external tool availability and authentication status
- **External tools verification script** (`bin/external-tools-verify.sh`): End-to-end verification with 15 checks covering shared helpers, both adapters, and file existence
- **External tools detection in start-task**: `/start-task` now auto-detects installed external tools and suggests enabling them
- **External tools onboarding**: Added external tools sections to INSTALL.md, GETTING_STARTED.md, and CLAUDE.md template
- **`tribunal init` copies external-tools.yaml**: Copies config template to `.tribunal/` during project initialization (disabled by default)

### Changed
- Updated counts: 8 skills (was 7), 8 commands (was 8), 7 rubrics (was 7)
- CLAUDE.md template now includes external tools section
- Start-task command includes external tools availability check as step 0.5

## 0.5.0

### Added
- **Team Mode** support with dual-mode coordination: uses `TeamCreate`/`SendMessage` when available, falls back to `Task` mode automatically
- **Plan Review Gate** (`skills/plan-review-gate/SKILL.md`): 3 adversarial reviewers (Feasibility, Completeness, Scope & Alignment) validate every implementation plan before execution begins
- **6 development guides** (`guides/`): agent-coordination, git-workflow, testing-patterns, coding-standards, worktree-development, build-validation
- **Adversarial plan review rubric** (`rubrics/plan-review-rubric.md`)
- Previously untracked framework files now included (commands, plugin copies, rubrics, templates, scripts)

### Fixed
- 132 "(example path)" rendering bugs across 19 agent files

### Changed
- Updated counts: 7 skills (was 6), 8 commands (was 7), 7 rubrics (was 6)
- CLI scaffolding updated with new templates and guides

## 0.4.1

### Changed
- Site updates for v0.4.0 process improvements

## 0.4.0

### Added
- **Plan validation pre-flight checklist**: Catches structural issues (architecture, dependencies, API contracts, security, UI/UX, external dependencies) before design review
- **UX Reviewer**: Added as 6th design review agent to verify user flows and integration work units
- **Project context document**: Maintained by orchestrator, passed to each coder subagent to prevent context loss
